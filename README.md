### Abstract: 
After the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case spread rapidly in Wuhan-China in December 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that this is a dangerous virus that can be spread from humans to humans through droplets and airborne. As for prevention, wearing a face mask is essential while going outside or meeting with others. Moreover, developing the face mask detector is very crucial in this case.

### Scope: 
The idea is to create a mask detection system that can be employed at different organizations and can fit into door opening systems to check whether employees/clients/customers are wearing masks to prevent deadly viruses.

### Entire project: 
Door opening system. The system consists of 2 parts. 
1) Temperature checking system. 
2) Mask Detection system
If either of the systems returns a negative result, the doors wonâ€™t open.
 
### Mini project: 
Mask detection system. 

### Aim: 
To create a website that will check if the person is wearing a mask or not. 

### Target Audience: 
This web application is aimed at helping organizations take precautions against covid 19 by tracking whether employees are wearing masks.

### Tech Stack:
FrontEnd: Figma, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
BackEnd: Flask/Django
Libraries: OpenCV/Keras
